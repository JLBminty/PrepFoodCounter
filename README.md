# PrepFoodCounter
Track the amount of food is available in the store and manage workflow accordingly. This program reads the contents of orders and displays to the kitchen staff the live count of a pre-made item (i.e. fruit cup or salad) is left in stock, so that management can allocate resources to make more of low-stock items. (Currently in development)
